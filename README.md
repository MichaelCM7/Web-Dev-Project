## General Project Description.
#### Plateup is a smart and personalised meal planning tool meant to help users find recipes that match their dietary restrictions, preferences and the ingredients they have available on hand. Additionally, PlateUp generates customised weekly meal plans and auto-creates shopping lists based on the same meal plans. Users are also able to save their favourite recipes for future use. We, at PlateUp, aim to reduce the stress of last-minute meals and save time for all our customers.

## Solution Provided
#### PlateUp solves the common problem of time-consuming and ineffective meal planning. It eliminates the stress of searching for recipes only to realise that they don't align with personal dietary preferences, allergies and nutrition goals. The integrated filter allows our users to get recipes based on specific requirements and consequently create meal plans. Never again do you have to look for recipes only to find out you lack the ingredients. Additionally, our application creates shopping lists, thus providing end-to-end solutions for planning and meal preparation. We ensure that our users eat what works for them, using what they already have, avoiding last-minute grocery runs.

## Value Addition provided for the solution
#### Our app is set apart from the rest due to its ability to combine personalisation with practicality.PlateUp doesn't just find recipes for you, it curates options based on real user data. It saves you time, supports healthier eating habits, reduces food waste by making use of existing ingredients, and simplifies grocery shopping through auto-generated shopping lists. Our application makes meal planning a stress-free and enjoyable task and not just a chore.
